# Final-Project
## Computer Science final project

Researching QUIC - google new protocol.<br />
We use **selenium** python library https://pypi.org/project/selenium/ to open chrome and navigate through the internet and **browsermob-proxy** python library https://pypi.org/project/browsermob-proxy/ to export the sniffing data into HAR file.<br />
To analyze network traffic reported in the HAR file we use **haralyzer** python library https://pypi.org/project/haralyzer/ and report the result into a program report file.
