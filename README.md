Measuring QUIC - google new protocol performance compare to known protocols (h2..).<br />

We use *selenium* python library https://pypi.org/project/selenium/ to open chrome and navigate through the internet and *browsermob-proxy* python library https://pypi.org/project/browsermob-proxy/ to export the sniffing data into HAR file.<br />
To analyze network traffic reported in the HAR file we use *haralyzer* python library https://pypi.org/project/haralyzer/ and report the result into a program report file.
